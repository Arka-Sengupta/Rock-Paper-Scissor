# Rock-Paper-Scissor
## 🪨 📝 ✂️
The traditional game of rock 🪨 , paper 📝 and scissors ✂️ but in python 3
The game is played in python 3 between the user and the computer where the computer uses a list from where it extracts data of the next move using the random built-in module of python
I know its a simple project, but it may help me achieving my goal in Python and other programming languages by learning from it


If you want you can make suggestions or mail me one 😄
